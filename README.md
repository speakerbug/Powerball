# Powerball

I got bored while waiting for the Powerball results to come in and made a quick Python program to determine if any of your numbers match.

# Usage

Edit the file `tickets.txt` with the numbers you have purchased where the Powerball is the last number.

```bash
$ python powerball.py <winning numbers> <powerball>
```
